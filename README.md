## Bike-Time-Training-Calculator

Calculate and log bike times for race training

The bike time training calculator is an application to calculate and log bike training times.  The time is calculated using distance and speed. The user enters the distance and speed into a form and the result in time is calculated. The user can also go to the Time Calculation page to log previous training times. 

## Getting-Started

First time users visiting the page would be directed to create an account. If the user has already created an account they can just log in to use the application.  Once an account is created the user follows the link on the home page to begin calculating ride times.  By entering in the distance and speed from a specific bike training session, the application calculates the time and displays it on the page. At the bottom of the page the user can then click on a link to log the time and be directed to the Training Log page. 

## Training-Log-Page

On the training log page the user will enter the date to be associated with that ride time and click the "add" button to log the information and store it for future reference. The log shows all the training times entered along with the distance, speed, time and date of each ride. 

## Adding-Previous-Ride-Times

A user can also add a previous training time to the log by adding their own distance, speed and time into the form on the Training Log Page and add their training time to the training log. The previous training time will be added and logged by date.

This application was co-written with Lee Warrick.
